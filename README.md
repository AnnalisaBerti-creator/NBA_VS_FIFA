# NBA Finals vs FIFA Club World Cup: Who Won in America?

This scrollytelling project analyzes and compares Americansâ€™ online interest between the **NBA Finals** and the **FIFA Club World Cup** in June 2025, using Google Trends data to show the geographic and temporal evolution of sports passions across the United States.

## Project Overview

In June 2025, an analysis of Google Trends data reveals how American interest was divided between two major global sporting events: the NBA Finals and the FIFA Club World Cup. While the NBA Finals are a well-established tradition in the U.S., FIFA invested heavily in the Club World Cup to expand soccer's influence in a market still dominated by basketball and American football.

By focusing on online search volumes during June (before the FIFA final played in July), this project highlights key moments of interest for both events and visualizes how those interests vary across different states and cities in the U.S.

## Features

- Interactive scrollytelling format with sticky elements and dynamic maps.
- Graphs illustrating the peaks of national online interest for both sports.
- Geographic distribution of search interest showing contrasting patterns for NBA and FIFA.
- Percentage comparison of online interest between the two sports across all U.S. states.

## Technologies Used
